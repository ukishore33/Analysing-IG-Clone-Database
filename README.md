The aim of the project was to extract relevant data from the dataset representing a social media platform.

The Instagram Clone dataset was transferred to MySQL using the Import Wizard.

Concepts like Aggregate functions, Group By, Temporary Tables, Views, and Stored Procedures  were used to fetch required results.

The dataset was used to extract information of users such as the five users who have been for longer period of time, a list of users who have never posted, total number of posted users and average number of posts every user posts, top 5 most used hashtags,  list of users who have liked every single photo, a list of users who have never commented on any photo or have commented on every photo.

#### The link of Sql file attached below contains 9 queries using which we retrieve the lists asked by investors.
